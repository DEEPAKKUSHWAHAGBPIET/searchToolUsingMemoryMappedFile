A page is a fixed size block of data in virtual memory
and a frame is a fixed size block of physical memory 
in RAM where these pages are loaded. Think of a page as
a piece of a puzzle (virtual memory) While, a frame as the
spot where it fits on the board (physical memory). 
When a program runs its pages are mapped to available frames so the program can run even
if the program size is larger than physical memory.
